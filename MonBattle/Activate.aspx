        Monbattle was designed by fans of Monster Battling games for fans of Monster Battling games. There will be a new monster battle each day. So remember to login each day and vote. If you vote for the most popular monster, you earn Monbattle Points (MP)! Trust me, you'll want to get as many MP as you can ;) 

        We are in the process of building an exciting battle system for players, so make sure you upload a monster through the Profile page, and stay tuned for updates.
